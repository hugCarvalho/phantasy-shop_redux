### Description

This project consists on a phantasy online shop where you can book days with actors of the Breaking Bad series (one of my favorites! ). The data is a mixture of the Breaking Bad API data and object manipulation in order to add the necessary entries for a shop behaviour.

### Functionalities so far

- data fetch from Breaking Bad API
- add / remove items to /from cart
- cart icon with updated nÂ° of items in cart
- add days up to inventory limit
- basic subtotal and total calculation
- Unavailable button state if a given condition is met
- Login and Register form (incomplete behaviour)
